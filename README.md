The successor, a more feature-rich version, is now accessible at the following link: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.snaggle.ksw_toolkit. This updated version has been meticulously developed from the ground up with an emphasis on stability and the seamless integration of new functionalities. Although this repository is no longer actively maintained, it remains available for the submission of any arising issues.

# KSW-ToolKit-Service

This is the background service to go along with [KSW-ToolKit](https://github.com/Snaggly/KSW-ToolKit). It will install itself as a background system service and hijacks the original McuService of the KSW Android screens. When hijacked, this program serves as a full replacement to the original software which you can highly tweak and customize using the KSW-ToolKit GUI frontend.
