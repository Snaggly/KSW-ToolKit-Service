# KSW-ToolKit-Service

This is the background service to go along with [KSW-ToolKit](https://github.com/Snaggly/KSW-ToolKit). It will install itself as a background system service and hijacks the original McuService of the KSW Android screens. When hijacked, this program serves as a full replacement to the original software which you can highly tweak and customize using the KSW-ToolKit GUI frontend.
