- Allow OEM Radio on switching with Sound Retorer
- Configuration Export/Import
- Check Build.prop what options there is!
- Give Tasker read_logs
- Give Dashacka's Standalone Dashboard Read_Logs
- Hide taskbar (global immersive mode - adb shell settings put global policy_control immersive.full=*, without start show again)
- Make taskbar smaller https://f30.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?p=25521166&postcount=1330
- Change dpi
- Change shutdown time [ cmdType:11 - data:05-01 ]
- Show demo mode
- As Threaded as Headset, High Volume warning does lower the volume at boot.
This can be changed by adding "audio.safemedia.bypass=true" to system/build.prop
- List all McuEvents to bind to start Intents and Android KeyEvents (lots of work)
- I would also like to be able to capture the OEM phone button event to map it to the phone icon of FlowUx-synesthesia
- Start/Stop McuService
- build.prop editor
- Persist partition bootanimation delete / remove bootanimation
- Auto Volume according to speed


Note: To disable OEM Voice Assistant:
I can confirm setting SVS_EIN_AUS in HU or COMBOX (if you have one) to nicht_active disables OEM voice assistant on F series
[07:55]
And MULF should be COMBOX for E series if I understand right
